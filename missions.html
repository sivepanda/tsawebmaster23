            <p>Due to the long training period and high demand, trips may be booked up to 6 months in advance, new bookings are available every week on Wednesday at 12 CST.

                Here at Retrograde we care deeply for the health and satisfaction of our customers. Due to that we have a mandatory health screening done by professionals to ensure against any negative effects that may occur in the conditions faced by astronauts. Some common health conditions that disqualify an individual from flight are: pregnancy, cardiovascular conditions, recent surgery or medical procedure and proneness to seizures. If you are disqualified from flight you will be offered a full refund of your ticket purchase.
                <br><br>
                If you have no disqualifying health conditions, your reservation will be set and a month before your launch date starts the training period. At Oxomo Space Center off the shores of Cancun, in Isla del Estrellas, you will be treated like royalty. As part of your experience, you get to spend the entirety of your training period in our state of the art facility.

            <h1>Training</h1>
            <p>Due to the harsh environments faced by outer space travelers, passengers flying with Retrograde are required to undergo a 
                month-long training process. The training starts with a week of basic online classes teaching you everything you need to 
                know. The following in person week is full of many different hands-on lessons using our space vehicle mockups. The next 
                week concludes the training process with an underwater buoyancy simulation of the experience in our large pool containing 
                more space vehicle mockups for hands-on training. The final week consists of much review and a comprehensive exam to 
                guarantee your safety in space. For repeat passengers the training process is not required as long as one can pass the 
                in person exam.

            <h1>Vehicles</h1>

                Retrograde employs three different launch systems: Heimdall, Savitir, and Aether. Each launch system specializes in 
                achieving different launch targets, and are specifically designed to be as safe and efficient as possible in reaching 
                their respective targets.
                <br><br>
                The efficiency afforded by our ultra high efficiency Heimdall launch system is second to none, and allows us to ensure 
                your flight is as cost effective and safe as possible. As our Low Earth Orbit launch system, Heimdall designed to lift 
                a payload that solely holds the Thor orbiter and some additional cargo, maximizing space for safety systems and comfort 
                on your orbit around Earth. 
                <br><a href="heimdall.html">Learn more ></a>
                <br><br>
                Savitir is equally as efficient for its job. Taking you into Medium Earth Orbit into our state of the art space station, 
                it boasts significantly more power and size to bring large amounts of cargo up into space. Savitir supports lifting 
                equipment for laboratory experiments and movie studio equipment safely, while also providing luxurious comfort for all 
                passengers on their way to our Fines Terrae space station that we operate in conjunction with a number of other travel 
                and international space agencies.

                <br><br>
                Aether is the most powerful rocket currently in production. Taking full advantage of Retrogradeâ€™s groundbreaking 
                research and harnessing of nuclear fusion to power our rockets, Aether is the sole rocket in production where all 
                stages are nuclear powered. As a result, a trip to the moon that once took weeks now takes mere hours. Our Hyperion 
                lander is the epitome of both comfort and cargo space, supporting a whopping 20 people and 30 tons of cargo into deep
                 space. Aether is not only perfect for a vacation to the moon, but also for deep space cargo, supporting affordable 
                 missions to Mars and beyond.

            <h1>Safety</h1>
            <p>We here at Retrograde value your safety. Using rockets to travel to space inherently carries a large amount of risk. 
                In order to reduce this chance of serious injury we are Retrograde use state of the art engineering redundancies, 
                techniques and failsafes. to make your trip as fun and safe as possible. One such example of redundancy is the extra 
                set of parachutes integrated in our crew capsules.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="infoss" value="launc" style="display:none;">
            <h1>Launch</h1>
            <p>After training comes the launch. Due to the angle of our launch and the location of our launch facility we are able to have one launch every 24 hours. The pre-launch process takes a few hours to complete. After taking the shuttle to the launch platform, you take the elevator up to the loading zone. At the loading zone passengers will be seated and strapped in securely by our trained professionals one by one. Due to our high safety standards, pre-flight checks usually take up to an hour after you are seated. Concluding with our tests starts the countdown. After starting the engines and hitting zero you're off to space. Enjoy your trip!</p>
        </div>

        <div class="infoss" value="recov" style="display:none;">
            <h1>Recovery</h1>
            <p>Thanks to recent advancements in rocket technology, we at Retrograde use fully reusable Vertical Takeoff, Vertical Landing 
                (VTVL) rocket systems to cut down costs and improve recovery. After your trip concludes the crew capsule will touchdown 
                in the sea within 20 miles of our launch facility at Oxomo Space Center. After landing, our crew will be dispatched to
                 pick you up and transport you to our facilities. After retrieval comes a quick medical check up to ensure no health 
                 conditions were caused or elevated by space. The trip concludes with a week of rest and recuperation at our 5 star hotel
                  to familiarize yourself with living back on Earth.
