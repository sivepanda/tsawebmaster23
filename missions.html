                Here at Retrograde we care deeply for the health and satisfaction of our customers. Due to that we have a mandatory health screening done by professionals to ensure against any negative effects that may occur in the conditions faced by astronauts. Some common health conditions that disqualify an individual from flight are: pregnancy, cardiovascular conditions, recent surgery or medical procedure and proneness to seizures. If you are disqualified from flight you will be offered a full refund of your ticket purchase.
                <br><br>
                If you have no disqualifying health conditions, your reservation will be set and a month before your launch date starts the training period. At Oxomo Space Center off the shores of Cancun, in Isla del Estrellas, you will be treated like royalty. As part of your experience, you get to spend the entirety of your training period in our state of the art facility.

                    know. The following in person week is full of many different hands-on lessons using our space vehicle mockups. The next 
                    week concludes the training process with an underwater buoyancy simulation of the experience in our large pool containing 
                    more space vehicle mockups for hands-on training. The final week consists of much review and a comprehensive exam to 
                    guarantee your safety in space. For repeat passengers the training process is not required as long as one can pass the 
                    in person exam.

                it boasts significantly more power and size to bring large amounts of cargo up into space. Savitir supports lifting 
                equipment for laboratory experiments and movie studio equipment safely, while also providing luxurious comfort for all 
                passengers on their way to our Fines Terrae space station that we operate in conjunction with a number of other travel

                Aether is the most powerful rocket currently in production. Taking full advantage of Retrograde’s groundbreaking 
                research and harnessing of nuclear fusion to power our rockets, Aether is the sole rocket in production where all 
                stages are nuclear powered. As a result, a trip to the moon that once took weeks now takes mere hours. Our Hyperion 
                lander is the epitome of both comfort and cargo space, supporting a whopping 20 people and 30 tons of cargo into deep
                 space. Aether is not only perfect for a vacation to the moon, but also for deep space cargo, supporting affordable 
                 missions to Mars and beyond.

                        During spaceflight, astronauts are exposed to a microgravity environment where they experience a sensation of weightlessness. However, this lack of gravity can cause a host of physical problems, including muscle atrophy, bone density loss, and altered balance and coordination. As a result, the Retrograde training program will involve exercises to maintain strength, flexibility, and cardiovascular fitness, as well as simulations of zero-gravity conditions to prepare them for the real thing.

                        During a spacewalk or other activities outside the spacecraft, astronauts are exposed to the vacuum of space. If not properly trained and prepared, this exposure can lead to decompression sickness, a potentially life-threatening condition caused by the rapid release of nitrogen bubbles in the bloodstream. Our program will help the astronauts receive extensive training on proper pressure and oxygen management to prevent decompression sickness.

                Here at Retrograde we care deeply for the health and satisfaction of our customers. Due to that we have a mandatory health screening done by professionals to ensure against any negative effects that may occur in the conditions faced by astronauts. Some common health conditions that disqualify an individual from flight are: pregnancy, cardiovascular conditions, recent surgery or medical procedure and proneness to seizures. If you are disqualified from flight you will be offered a full refund of your ticket purchase.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you have no disqualifying health conditions, your reservation will be set and a month before your launch date starts the training period. At Oxomo Space Center off the shores of Cancun, in Isla del Estrellas, you will be treated like royalty. As part of your experience, you get to spend the entirety of your training period in our state of the art facility.

                more space vehicle mockups for hands-on training. The final week consists of much review and a comprehensive exam to

            <p>Retrograde employs three different launch systems: Heimdall, Savitir, and Aether. Each launch system specializes in 
                achieving different launch targets, and are specifically designed to be as safe and efficient as possible in reaching 
                their respective targets.
                <span><br><br></span>
                The efficiency afforded by our ultra high efficiency Heimdall launch system is second to none, and allows us to ensure 
                your flight is as cost effective and safe as possible. As our Low Earth Orbit launch system, Heimdall designed to lift 
                a payload that solely holds the Thor orbiter and some additional cargo, maximizing space for safety systems and comfort 
                on your orbit around Earth. 
                <span><br><br></span>

                Savitir is equally as efficient for its job. Taking you into Medium Earth Orbit into our state of the art space station, 
                it boasts significantly more power and size to bring large amounts of cargo up into space. Savitir supports lifting 
                equipment for laboratory experiments and movie studio equipment safely, while also providing luxurious comfort for all 
                passengers on their way to our Fines Terrae space station that we operate in conjunction with a number of other travel 
                and international space agencies. 
                <span><br><br></span>

                Aether is the most powerful rocket currently in production. Taking full advantage of Retrograde’s groundbreaking 
                research and harnessing of nuclear fusion to power our rockets, Aether is the sole rocket in production where all 
                stages are nuclear powered. As a result, a trip to the moon that once took weeks now takes mere hours. Our Hyperion 
                lander is the epitome of both comfort and cargo space, supporting a whopping 20 people and 30 tons of cargo into deep
                 space. Aether is not only perfect for a vacation to the moon, but also for deep space cargo, supporting affordable 
                 missions to Mars and beyond.
