        <h2 style="color:black">Fusion Breakthrough</h2>
        <p>Retrograde is proud to be a driving part of developmental breakthroughs throughout the world. As part of our program, we provide cutting edge research and scientific resources to public research facilities, including the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory’s National Ignition Facility. A team of Retrograde scientists and engineers were instrumental in the success of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory's fusion experiment. The Retrograde team was able to apply their expertise in materials science to develop a new material that could withstand the extreme temperatures and pressures required for nuclear fusion. This breakthrough enabled the Lawrence Livermore team to achieve a major milestone in their quest for practical fusion energy. In the wake of their success, we talked to the team leader about the team’s involvement in the project:
            <br><br>
            As a researcher at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory’s National Ignition Facility (NIF), I have had the opportunity to work on some of the most cutting-edge scientific experiments in the world. At the NIF, we are focused on achieving fusion energy, which is the same process that powers the sun.
            <br><br>
            The NIF is a unique facility that is designed to create and study high-energy density plasmas, which are the same conditions that occur inside a star during the fusion process. Our goal is to achieve fusion ignition, which is the point at which the energy output from the fusion reaction exceeds the energy input required to initiate it. If we can achieve ignition, it could be a major breakthrough in the quest for clean, sustainable energy.
            <br><br>
            One of the key tools we use at the NIF is a giant laser that can focus 192 individual beams onto a tiny target the size of a pencil eraser. This creates intense pressure and temperature conditions that are necessary to initiate the fusion process. Our experiments require precision and accuracy to ensure that the laser beams hit the target at the exact same time and with the exact same intensity.
            <br><br>
            But achieving ignition is not an easy task. We are dealing with incredibly complex physics, and we are constantly working to improve our understanding of the processes involved. One of the challenges we face is that the plasmas we create are highly unstable, and they can be difficult to control. We need to find ways to stabilize the plasma and prevent it from breaking apart before the fusion reaction can occur.
            <br><br>
            Another challenge is that the conditions inside the target can create a lot of debris that can damage the equipment we use to create the plasma. We need to find ways to mitigate this debris and ensure that our equipment can continue to function effectively.
            <br><br>
            Despite these challenges, we have made significant progress in our research. We have achieved record-breaking levels of pressure and temperature, and we are constantly improving our techniques to create more stable plasmas. We are also exploring new approaches to fusion, such as using alternative fuels and different types of lasers.
            <br><br>
            At the NIF, we are not just working to achieve fusion ignition. We are also conducting research that has broader implications for science and technology. For example, our work on high-energy-density plasmas is helping to improve our understanding of astrophysics, materials science, and the behavior of matter under extreme conditions.
            <br><br>
            In addition, our laser technology has applications beyond fusion. It is used in fields such as materials processing, medicine, and national security. We are constantly finding new ways to use our technology to advance science and society.
            <br><br>
            As a researcher at the NIF, I am proud to be part of a team that is pushing the boundaries of science and technology. Our work is challenging, but it is also incredibly rewarding. If we can achieve fusion ignition, it could be a game-changer for the energy industry and for our planet. But even if we don't achieve ignition, our research is advancing our understanding of the universe and helping to improve our world in countless other ways.
            <br><br><br>
            The impact of this breakthrough was significant for the space industry. Nuclear fusion has the potential to revolutionize space exploration by providing a virtually unlimited source of energy for spacecraft propulsion systems. The success of the Lawrence Livermore experiment showed that fusion energy was not just a theoretical concept, but a practical reality that could be achieved with the right materials and technology.

        <h2 style="color:black">Hermes Nominal!</h2>
        <p>Hermes II is a fusion thruster that has been under development for quite some time. Recently, the team behind the project announced that they have achieved a significant milestone in the testing of the thrusters. The results showed a 350% increase in efficiency compared to methalox, with 150% left to go to reach their target goal.
            <br><br>
            This achievement is a remarkable step forward for the field of space propulsion. Fusion thrusters are a promising technology that could revolutionize space travel by providing a highly efficient and sustainable means of propulsion. However, there are still many challenges to overcome before these thrusters can become a practical solution for space travel.
            <br><br>
            One of the biggest challenges is the development of high-performance materials that can withstand the extreme temperatures and pressures generated by fusion reactions. Another challenge is developing efficient methods for producing the fuel that powers the fusion reactions. Despite these challenges, the team behind the Hermes II project has made significant progress towards achieving their goal.
            <br><br>
            The testing of the Hermes II fusion thrusters involved a process known as static testing. Static testing is a method of testing rocket engines that does not involve actual flight. Instead, the thrusters are mounted in a test stand and fired to simulate the conditions they would experience during flight. This allows the team to evaluate the performance of the thrusters under controlled conditions and make any necessary adjustments before they are used in a real-world setting.
            <br><br>
            The results of the static testing on the Hermes II fusion thrusters are impressive. The thrusters showed a 350% increase in efficiency compared to Methane - Liquid Oxygen (methalox). methalox is a commonly used propellant in rocket engines that provides a high level of performance but has significant drawbacks. methalox is highly flammable and can be dangerous to handle. It also requires a lot of energy to produce, making it an expensive fuel source.
            <br><br>
            The Hermes II fusion thrusters, on the other hand, use a different type of fuel that is much safer and more efficient. The fuel is based on deuterium and helium-3, which are isotopes of hydrogen. These fuels are abundant in space and can be extracted from the moon and other celestial bodies. Though less efficient than that of deuterium-tritium, use of these fuels being more abundant  could potentially make space travel more affordable and sustainable in the future.
            <br><br>
            Despite the impressive results of the static testing, the team behind the Hermes II project still has some work to do before they can reach their target goal. They have reported that they still need to achieve a 150% increase in efficiency to reach their target. This may sound like a significant challenge, but it is important to remember that the testing of fusion thrusters is a complex process that requires a lot of experimentation and refinement.
            <br><br>
            In conclusion, the static testing of the Hermes II fusion thrusters is a significant step forward in the development of sustainable and efficient space propulsion systems. The results are impressive, showing a 350% increase in efficiency compared to methalox. While there is still work to be done, the progress made by the team behind the project is a promising sign that fusion thrusters could play a significant role in the future of space travel.
